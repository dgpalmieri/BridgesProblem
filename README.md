# CS411 Homework 2 - The Bridges Problem
The objective of this homework is to find an optimal solution to the given
problem, utilizing exhaustive search and recursive backtracking.

## Description (from the assignment)
A river flows from north to south. There are cities on the west bank and cities
on the east bank. We wish to build bridges across the river. Each bridge will
join a west-bank city with an east-bank city. We wish to choose the bridges we
build in such a way as to maximize the tolls we collect from people crossing
them. There are two restrictions on the bridges we build. First, no city can
have more than one bridge reaching it. Second, no two bridges can cross each
other.
Concerning the second condition: the cities on each bank are numbered. There 
are *w* cities on the west bank, numbered 0, 1, ..., *w* - 1 (starting at zero,
because weâ€™re computer scientists), and there are *e* cities on the east bank,
numbered 0, 1, ..., *e* - 1. Suppose one bridge joins city aon the west to city
b on the east. Another bridge joins city con the west to city don the east. If
a<c and b>d, then these two bridges cross each other, and we are not allowed to
build both. For each pair of cities we might build a bridge between, we know the
toll we will collect from it. Building a bridge never affects the toll collected
from another bridge.
